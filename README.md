AI agents get filesystem access, run shell commands, and are wide open to prompt injections. The standard response is guardrails and policies. The problem is that policies can be bypassed — and guardrails can be talked out of.

With nono, you don't have to. nono wraps your agent in a kernel-isolated sandbox in seconds — with API key protection, destructive action guardrails, and full snapshot/rollback built in. No hypervisor to configure. No container volume mounts. Zero latency overhead.

---

**Platform support:** macOS and Linux now. Windows coming soon.

**Homebrew (macOS/Linux)**
```bash
brew install nono
```

**Other install options**

Prebuilt binaries and package manager instructions are in the [Installation Guide](https://docs.nono.sh/cli/getting_started/installation).
## CLI

The CLI is the quickest way to get going! zero startup latency, no need to install hypervisors, runtimes, mount volumes...sandboxed and protected in a single command

```bash
# Any CLI agent — just put your command after --
nono run --profile claude-code -- claude
nono run --profile codex -- codex
nono run --profile opencode -- opencode
nono run --profile openclaw -- openclaw
nono run --profile swival -- swival

nono run --allow-cwd -- python3 my_agent.py
nono run --allow-cwd -- npx @anthropic/agent-framework

# MCP servers, agents, anything!
nono run --read /data -- npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /data
nono run --profile pydantic-ai-agent --allow logs/ -- uv run my_agent.py
nono run --profile custom-profile -- node agent.js
```

Built-in profiles for [Claude Code](https://docs.nono.sh/cli/clients/claude-code), [Codex](https://docs.nono.sh/cli/clients/codex), [OpenCode](https://docs.nono.sh/cli/clients/opencode), [OpenClaw](https://docs.nono.sh/cli/clients/openclaw), and [Swival](https://docs.nono.sh/cli/clients/swival) — or define your own with custom permissions.

## Library

The core is a Rust library that can be embedded into any application via native bindings. The library is a policy-free sandbox primitive -- it applies only what clients explicitly request.

```rust
use nono::{CapabilitySet, Sandbox};

let mut caps = CapabilitySet::new();
caps.allow_read("/data/models")?;
caps.allow_write("/tmp/workspace")?;

Sandbox::apply(&caps)?;  // Irreversible — kernel-enforced from here on
```

```python
from nono_py import CapabilitySet, AccessMode, apply

caps = CapabilitySet()
caps.allow_path("/data/models", AccessMode.READ)
caps.allow_path("/tmp/workspace", AccessMode.READ_WRITE)

apply(caps)  # Apply CapabilitySet
```

```typescript
import { CapabilitySet, AccessMode, apply } from "nono-ts";

const caps = new CapabilitySet();
caps.allowPath("/data/models", AccessMode.Read);
caps.allowPath("/tmp/workspace", AccessMode.ReadWrite);

apply(caps);  // Irreversible — kernel-enforced from here on
```

## Features

### Kernel-Enforced Sandbox

nono applies OS-level restrictions that cannot be bypassed or escalated from within the sandboxed process. Permissions are defined as capabilities granted before execution -- once the sandbox is applied, it is irreversible. All child processes inherit the same restrictions.

| Platform | Mechanism | Minimum Kernel |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| macOS | Seatbelt | 10.5+ |
| Linux | Landlock | 5.13+ |

```bash
# Grant read to src, write to output — everything else is denied by the kernel
nono run --read ./src --write ./output -- cargo build
```

### Credential Injection

Two modes: **proxy injection** keeps credentials entirely outside the sandbox — the agent connects to `localhost` and the proxy injects real API keys into upstream requests. **Env injection** loads secrets from the OS keystore, 1Password, or Apple Passwords and injects them as environment variables before the sandbox locks.

```bash
# Proxy mode — agent never sees the API key, even in its own memory
nono run --network-profile claude-code --proxy-credential openai -- my-agent

# Env mode — simpler, but secret is in the process environment
nono run --env-credential openai_api_key --allow-cwd -- my-agent

# 1Password — map URI reference to destination env var
nono run --env-credential-map 'op://Development/OpenAI/credential' OPENAI_API_KEY --allow-cwd -- my-agent

# Apple Passwords (macOS) — map URI reference to destination env var
nono run --env-credential-map 'apple-password://github.com/alice@example.com' GITHUB_PASSWORD --allow-cwd -- my-agent
```

### Agent SKILL Provenance and Supply Chain Security

Instruction files (SKILLS.md, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, AGENT.MD) and associated artifacts such as scripts are a supply chain attack vector. nono cryptographically signs and verifies them using Sigstore attestation with DSSE envelopes and in-toto / SLSA style statements. It supports keyed signing (system keystore) and keyless signing (OIDC via GitHub Actions + Fulcio + Rekor). Upon execution, nono verifies the signature, checks the signing certificate against trusted roots, and validates the statement predicates (e.g. signed within the last 30 days, signed by a trusted maintainer).

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/nono-attest">
    <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub_Action-nono--attest-2088FF?style=for-the-badge&logo=github-actions&logoColor=white" alt="nono-attest GitHub Action"/>
  </a>
</p>

Sign instruction files directly within GitHub Actions workflows. Users can then verify that files originate from the expected repository and branch, signed by a trusted maintainer.

### Network Filtering

Allowlist-based host filtering via a local proxy. The sandbox blocks all direct outbound connections — the agent can only reach explicitly allowed hosts. Cloud metadata endpoints are hardcoded as denied.

```bash
nono run --allow-proxy api.openai.com --allow-proxy api.anthropic.com -- my-agent

# Keep the claude-code profile, but allow unrestricted network for this session
nono run --profile claude-code --allow-net -- claude
```

### Supervisor and Capability Expansion

On Linux, seccomp user notification intercepts syscalls when the agent needs access outside its sandbox. The supervisor prompts the user, then injects the file descriptor directly — the agent never executes its own `open()`. Sensitive paths are never-grantable regardless of approval.

```bash
nono run --rollback --supervised --profile claude-code --allow-cwd -- claude
```

### Undo and Snapshots

Content-addressable snapshots of your working directory taken before and during sandboxed execution. SHA-256 deduplication and Merkle tree commitments for integrity verification. Interactively review and restore individual files or the entire directory. Known regenerable directories (`.git`, `target`, `node_modules`, etc.) and directories with more than 10,000 files are auto-excluded from snapshots to prevent hangs on large projects.

```bash
# Zero-flag usage — auto-excludes large/regenerable directories
nono run --rollback --allow . -- npm test

# Force-include an auto-excluded directory
nono run --rollback --rollback-include target -- cargo build

# Exclude a custom directory from rollback
nono run --rollback --rollback-exclude vendor -- go test ./...

# Disable rollback entirely
nono run --no-rollback --allow . -- npm test

nono rollback list
nono rollback restore
```

### Composable Policy Groups

Security policy defined as named groups in a single JSON file. Profiles reference groups by name — compose fine-grained policies from reusable building blocks.

```json
{
  "deny_credentials": {
    "deny": { "access": ["~/.ssh", "~/.gnupg", "~/.aws", "~/.kube"] }
  },
  "node_runtime": {
    "allow": { "read": ["~/.nvm", "~/.fnm", "~/.npm"] }
  }
}
```

### Destructive Command Blocking

Dangerous commands (`rm`, `dd`, `chmod`, `sudo`, `scp`) are blocked before execution. Override per invocation with `--allow-command` or permanently via `allowed_commands` in a profile. Block additional commands with `add_deny_commands`.

```bash
$ nono run --allow-cwd -- rm -rf /
nono: blocked command: rm

# Override per invocation
nono run --allow-cwd --allow-command rm -- rm ./temp-file.txt

# Override via profile
# { "security": { "allowed_commands": ["rm"] } }
nono run --profile my-profile -- rm /tmp/old-file.txt

# Block specific commands in a profile (add_deny_commands) — pairs with add_deny_access for sockets
# { "policy": { "add_deny_access": ["/var/run/docker.sock"], "add_deny_commands": ["docker", "kubectl"] } }
nono run --profile no-docker -- claude
```

> [!WARNING]
> Command blocking is defense-in-depth layered on top of the kernel sandbox. Commands can bypass this via `sh -c '...'` or wrapper scripts — the sandbox filesystem restrictions are the real security boundary.

### Themes

nono ships with multiple color themes inspired by popular terminal palettes. The default is **Catppuccin Mocha**.

| Theme | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `mocha` | Catppuccin Mocha -- warm dark (default) |
| `latte` | Catppuccin Latte -- clean light |
| `frappe` | Catppuccin Frappe -- muted dark |
| `macchiato` | Catppuccin Macchiato -- deep vivid dark |
| `tokyo-night` | Tokyo Night -- cool blues and purples |
| `minimal` | Grayscale with orange accent |

```bash
# Per invocation
nono --theme tokyo-night run --allow-cwd -- my-agent

# Via environment variable
export NONO_THEME=latte

# Via config file (~/.config/nono/config.toml)
# [ui]
# theme = "frappe"
```

### Audit Trail

Every supervised session automatically records command, timing, exit code, network events, and cryptographic snapshot commitments as structured JSON. Opt out with `--no-audit`.

```bash
nono audit list
nono audit show 20260216-193311-20751 --json
```

## Quick Start

### Homebrew (macOS/Linux)

```bash
brew install nono
```

### Other Linux Install Options

See the [Installation Guide](https://docs.nono.sh/cli/getting_started/installation) for prebuilt binaries and package manager instructions.

### From Source

See the [Development Guide](https://docs.nono.sh/cli/development/index) for building from source.

## Supported Clients

nono ships with built-in profiles for popular AI coding agents. Each profile defines audited, minimal permissions.

| Client | Profile | Docs |
|--------|---------|------|
| **Claude Code** | `claude-code` | [Guide](https://docs.nono.sh/cli/clients/claude-code) |
| **Codex** | `codex` | [Guide](https://docs.nono.sh/cli/clients/codex) |
| **OpenCode** | `opencode` | [Guide](https://docs.nono.sh/cli/clients/opencode) |
| **OpenClaw** | `openclaw` | [Guide](https://docs.nono.sh/cli/clients/openclaw) |
| **Swival** | `swival` | [Guide](https://docs.nono.sh/cli/clients/swival) |

Custom profiles can [extend built-in ones](https://docs.nono.sh/cli/features/profiles-groups) with `"extends": "claude-code"` (or multiple: `"extends": ["claude-code", "node-dev"]`) to inherit all settings and add overrides. nono is agent-agnostic and works with any CLI command. See the [full documentation](https://docs.nono.sh) for usage details, configuration, and integration guides.
